# Quality Code

My personal recommendations for quality & clean code.

Some concepts of quality code :

- easy to read and understandable
- names should be meaningful
- be specific about names but not too much
- different concept should be vertically separated

## TODO

- [ ] implement tabs like https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/ban-tslint-comment.mdx?plain=1
- [ ] Change default page
- [ ] find a icon
- [ ] update homepage
- [ ] update header and footer
- [x] merge resources / articles
